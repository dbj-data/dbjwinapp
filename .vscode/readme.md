This is mainly used for the stuff in the `workinprogress` folder

Primarily use Visual Studio for building this.
tasks.json in here is the default as generated by VS Code
which using CTRL+SHIFT+B works only on the active file (in the VS Code)
with the addition of /link arguments for building windows 
app with *.res files compiled in.

You know the drill...
